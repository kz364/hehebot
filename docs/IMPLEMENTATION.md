# Implementation status

Hehebot is a locally tested foundation, not an operational assistant. Direct Codex app-server **0.154.0** is the only supported harness. No cloud deployment or authenticated inference has been completed; production execution and native-verification flags remain false.

## Implemented locally

- Cloudflare Worker portal/API and one SQLite Durable Object per installation for commands, receipts, timelines, revisions, routines, occurrences, runs, scoped memory, policies, effects, locks, and lifecycle state.
- Owner JWT verification, origin checks, signed/deduplicated triggers, strict generated schemas, paginated events, and durable idempotency.
- Fenced epochs/leases, serialized lifecycle operations, bounded retries, drain/checkpoint contracts, cancellation isolation, and conservative unknown-effect handling.
- Codex stdio transport, durable submission/event journal, exact root/child identity, steering/cancel intent, scoped host tool callbacks, and supervisor/bridge fixtures.
- Managed skill proposals/revisions/per-bot enablement and routine create/list/inspect/edit/pause/resume/delete/run-now contracts.
- Numeric cron/timezone/DST/misfire behavior, reviewed disabled bot import, flight deadline ledger, provider adapters, and Sprite activity-hold components.
- Static portal and remote-only Electron desktop shell.

Scripted native fixtures demonstrate event routing, exact cancellation, callbacks into local Worker/SQLite, and conservative rejection of root-only completion. They do **not** prove model judgment, authenticated inference, recursive descendant/effect settlement, active-work crash recovery, production service assembly, provider sleep, connector behavior, or hardware permissions.

## Run and verify

```sh
bash .agents/setup
bash scripts/verify-codex.sh
npm ci --prefix desktop
npm test --prefix desktop
```

For focused checks use `npm test`, `npm run test:runtime`, `npm run test:e2e`, and `npm run build`. The build is a dry run and does not deploy. Report current command output rather than historical exact totals. HTTP and scripted-provider tests are not browser, model, account, or production acceptance.

## Remaining gates

1. Assemble the production Sprite service from supervisor, bridge, adapter, event router, tool handler, activity accounting, and Worker custody; test warm/cold wake, disconnect, lease loss, and uncertain admission.
2. Complete owner-authorized Codex login in the executing environment and verify model eligibility, no paid fallback, bounded inference, restart continuity, refresh ownership, and concurrent-turn behavior.
3. Establish authoritative recursive child/tool/effect settlement and exact cancellation. Root completion or cancellation acknowledgment is insufficient.
4. Complete intent-aware status/new-task/steer/deferred-follow-up behavior and the full portal/mobile/accessibility UX.
5. Verify every connector operation and scope independently, including Calendar writes, Gmail no-send enforcement, WhatsApp coverage, browser persistence, and Mac Messages/device permissions.
6. Complete retention, coordinated backup/restore, portable export/import, reconciliation UI, monitoring, crash tests, seven-day cost evidence, and production Access.

Passive context updates must remain zero-inference/zero-wake. Unknown effects remain parked, admitted work retains pinned policy/context identity, and one customer runtime remains the sole execution authority.
